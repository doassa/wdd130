        <p>I am Dorgelless Genevoix Assa, from the Ivory Coast. I am eager to be here, and love this oportunity to joing this community of Web Developers.</p>
        <p>Before enrolling in BYU Pathway Worldwide, I served a mission. After that, I didn't know exactly what to study, and was somewhat lost.</p>
        <p>I remember those days when I would just search something about computer science, simply because I have always loved computers and anything around it.</p>
        <p>When the time came to choose my desired certificate, I wasn't sure of what to choose, but decided that I'd study Web and Computer Programming.</p>
        <p>Here I am now, and I am glad to be with you all. I hope to learn a lot from you, in order to become a good web programmer / dersigner.</p>
